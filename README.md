# vue-figure

Figure is a foundational structure for the Vue.js framework that is based on the Vue CLI tool.

Essentially, this is how I personally prefer to set up all of my Vue.js projects.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your unit tests
```
npm run test:unit
```

### Run your end-to-end tests
```
npm run test:e2e
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
